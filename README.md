# chouse

Simple [Golang](https://golang.org/) wrapper for the [Companies House Rest API service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house).

Allows to perform API calls to look up company profile information among other details like company officers, filling history etc.

All API endpoints are supported and data returned is parsed JSON objects.

This project has no tests however it is being used in production at [coreportsly.com](http://coreportsly.com)

```

* Example code using this package

```golang
package main

import (
    "github.com/coreportsly/chouse"
)

func main() {
    ch := chouse.Explore('companyNumber')

    // get info about company
    data, err := ch.Company()
    // do something with error
    for _, c := range data {
        fmt.Println(c.CompanyName)
    }

    // get company's fillings of annual return type
    data, err := c.AnnualReturnsFilings()
    fmt.Println(data.Items[0].Date)
}
```
